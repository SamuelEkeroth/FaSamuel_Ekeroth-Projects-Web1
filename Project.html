          It is not uncommon for fashion brands to collaborate with other
          companies or brands to create unique and limited edition products. One
          such collaboration that has garnered significant attention in the
          fashion industry is the partnership between Nike and Louis Vuitton.
          The Nike and Louis Vuitton collaboration began in 2002, when the two
          brands joined forces to create a limited edition sneaker collection
          called "LV x Nike". The collection featured reinterpretations of some
          of Nike's most iconic shoe models, such as the Air Force 1 and the
          Dunk, with Louis Vuitton's signature monogrammed canvas and luxurious
          materials. The collaboration was a huge success, with the shoes
          quickly selling out and becoming highly sought-after by collectors and
          fashion enthusiasts. Since the initial collaboration, Nike and Louis
          Vuitton have continued to work together on various projects and
          collections. In 2017, the two brands released a new line of sneakers
          called the "LV x NikeLab Dunk Lux High". The shoes were designed by
          fashion designer Kim Jones, who was the artistic director of Louis
          Vuitton's men's wear collection at the time. The sneakers were made
          with premium materials, including leather and suede, and featured the
          Louis Vuitton monogram on the heel and tongue. The Nike and Louis
          Vuitton collaboration has been praised by both"
